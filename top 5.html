            <p>
              Sauvage by Dior is a highly concentrated interpretation, melding
              extreme freshness with warm ambery tones. The top scent notes are
              Calabrian bergamot, mandarin, cardamom, and elemi with vanilla and
              tonka bean giving the right amount of sweetness as base notes.

            <p>
              Eternity is a romantic floral fragrance that was inspired by
              lasting love. The top notes are lavender, lemon, bergamot, and
              mandarin orange. This one works for both him and her.

            />
            <p>
              The fragrance equivalent of a tired head submerging into a soft
              pillow, Ariana Grande’s Cloud combines dreamy possibilities with
              home-comforts and sultry enticements. The distinctive heady rush
              opens with lulling lavender notes and subtle hints of vanilla
              orchids. While unassuming pear auras and bold bergamot tangs speak
              to the tempting and intriguing.

              sweet vanilla, orange blossom, and jasmine will wake you up faster
              than any espresso ever could. Addictive? We’d say so. A firm
              favorite, it’s sexy, feminine, and bold, with a wide-eyed and
              awake sprinkle of notes gently complemented by a sugary softness.

            <p>
              There’s a reason many of the top perfumes for women ooze floral
              notes. Delighting our senses, the natural beauty of flowers has
              been a muse for artists, designers, and of course, perfumers,
              since time immemorial. But who does it best? Gucci Bloom wins the
              medal. Gucci Bloom boasts meticulously-extracted ingredients like
              Indian-grown tuberose and exquisite jasmine bud extract, truly

        <h3>Top 5 healthy Foods</h3>
        <div class="food">
          <div class="fish format">
            <h5>Fish</h5>
            <img src="gridimages/fish.jpg" alt="Fish" class="imgStyle" />
            <p>
              Eat plenty of fish, which are high in healthy omega 3 fatty acids,
              and smaller portions of red meat to reduce your risk of diseases
              like stroke, heart disease and cancer.

          <div class="broccoli format">
            <h5>Broccoli or any of the cruciferous vegetables</h5>

              class="imgStyle"
            />
            <p>
              These foods are rich in nutrients including glucosinolates, which
              are key in detoxification processes. These are best served raw or
              quick-steamed for five to ten minutes.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="beets format">
            <h5>Beetroots</h5>
            <img src="gridimages/beets.jpg" alt="Beets" class="imgStyle" />
            <p>
              No matter which color – red, yellow, golden – or which part – root
              or greens – they contain a wonderful variety of protective
              carotenoids. Evidence suggests their dietary nitrates can be
              converted to nitric oxide and improve endurance exercise.

            <p>
              These are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin: nutrients that can
              help protect against macular degeneration.

            <h5>Almonds</h5>
            <img src="gridimages/almonds.jpg" alt="Almonds" class="imgStyle" />
            <p>
              Almonds have a lot of vitamin E, which protects against macular
              degeneration as well as cataracts. I recommend eating just a
              handful a day.
